Dr. Goldberg's extensive research primarily focuses on abnormalities of lipoprotein metabolism, macrovascular disease in diabetes, and the role of triglycerides in atherosclerosis. 

He has contributed significantly to the field with over 200 published articles, including chapters on lipid disorders in renowned medical textbooks. His investigative studies, supported by numerous grants, delve into the atherogenicity of apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins, regulation of plasma triglyceride by lipase enzymes, diabetic macrovascular disease, and lipid uptake and toxicity in the heart.
